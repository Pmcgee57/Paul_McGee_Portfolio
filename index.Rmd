My name is Paul McGee and I am a recent MBA graduate from Binghamton University with a concentration in Business Analytics. I graduated in 2019 from SUNY New Paltz with a Bachelor of Science in Marketing. This site is a compilation of independent projects which I have completed relating to data analysis and data science.

The tabs at the top of the page can be used to navigate between the projects I currently have posted. Each projects involves some overlap of skills, but uses different analytical tools or methods to ultimately complete the task.
