### Using data cleaning, ggplot and dplyr to analyze numerically and visually data analyst positions by location, industry, and salary as well as performing text and sentiment analysis on the job descriptions.

&nbsp;  

This projects data was collected using webscraping from Glassdoor to compile data analyst positions listed across the united states.


I am interested in finding out:

* The distribution of salaries for data analyst positions
* What different industries are hiring data analysts?
* What these industries offer data analysts in salaries?
* Where are most of these positions located for analyst positions, by their respective industry?

&nbsp;  

### **Summary of findings from this analysis**

* New York is the city with the most jobs in the most industries that are hiring right now.

* Biotech is the industry which pays the most on average out of the top 20 industries with the most postings, while News pays the most overall on average.

* The top industries hiring include IT, Staffing, Health Care, Computer Hardware, Consulting and many more.

* A pessimistic estimate of the range of salaries for data analysts are between $29,000 -$112,000.

* SQL is the most common language that data analyst positions use in this data, with Excel and Python falling behind it. A small number of positions mention using all three. 

* Job descriptions overall are worded slightly positive, but are fairly neutral. It is rare you'll find any position that sounds too positive or negative overall. 

&nbsp;  

### **1. Loading in and cleaning the data**

I'll take a look at the data using the glimpse() function, since head() may not print nicely because of long text strings in the fields.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(tm)
library(syuzhet)
library(wordcloud)
library(data.table)
library(SentimentAnalysis)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_excel("C:/Users/pmcgee/Downloads/Analyst Portfolio/datasets/analyst_positions_data.xlsx")
glimpse(data)
```

&nbsp;  

Definitely will have some data cleaning to do with this. I'm going to:

* remove extra text from salary column
* remove the rating that shouldn't be in the company name column
* remove rows where salary = ""
* make salary and rating a numeric data type for analysis
```{r, include=FALSE}
data <- data %>% rename(Salary = `Salary Estimate` )
data_2 <- data

data_2$Salary <- gsub("[(Glassdoor est.)K$]", "", data$Salary)
unique(data_2$Salary)
data_3 <- data_2

data_3$Salary <- sub("\\-.*",'', perl = T, data_3$Salary)
unique(data_3$Salary)

#Remove rating from company name
data_3 <- data_3 %>% rename(Comp_name = `Company Name` )
data_3$Comp_name <- sub("\\s+[^ ]+$", "", data_3$Comp_name)


#remove rows where salary = ""
data_3 <- subset(data_3, Salary!="")
unique(data_3$Salary)

#make salary and rating numeric
data_3$Salary <- as.numeric(data_3$Salary)
data_3$Rating <- as.numeric(data_3$Rating)

#delete text after commas, slashes and dashes in job title

data_3$`Job Title`<- gsub("(.*),.*", "\\1", data_3$`Job Title`)
data_3$`Job Title`<- gsub("/.*", "", data_3$`Job Title`)
data_3$`Job Title`  <- gsub("-.*", "", data_3$`Job Title`)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
h_d3<- (data_3)
h_d3 <- h_d3 %>% select("Job Title",Salary, Rating, Comp_name)
h_d3<- head(h_d3)
h_d3 %>% kbl %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
I chose to keep the smallest value in the estimated salary range, so our data may look like salaries are on the low side.

&nbsp;  

### **2. Visualizing distribution of salaries**
I'll create a histogram and print summary statistics to see what the salary range is

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(data_3$Salary)
hist_sal<- data_3 %>% ggplot(aes(Salary)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, color = "white", fill = "black") +
  labs(title = "Data Analyst Positions Salaries") + ylab("# of Positions")
hist_sal
```

&nbsp;  

### **3. What industries are looking for Analysts?**
I'll see which industries have more analyst position postings right now. I'll view the top 20 industries.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data_4 <- data_3
indus_count <- data_4 %>% count(Industry) %>% arrange(desc(n))
indus_count <- subset(indus_count, Industry!="-1") 

head(indus_count,20) %>% kbl %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

&nbsp;  

Now I'll shorten the text in the industry column to just keep the first word and create a plot to visualize the results of industries with 40 or more job postings.
```{r, echo =FALSE}
indus_count <- indus_count %>% filter(n >= 40)
indus_count$Industry <- gsub(' [A-z ]*', '' ,indus_count$Industry)
indus_n <- indus_count

#shortening names
indus_n$Industry <- gsub("&", "", indus_n$Industry)
indus_n %>% kbl %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

#Plots of most frequent industries looking for analysts

indus_plot <- indus_n %>% ggplot(aes(x = Industry, y = n)) + geom_col(fill = 'sky blue', color = "black") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), legend.position="none") + ylab("Number of Positions")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
indus_plot + ggtitle("Industries with the Most Positions") + coord_flip() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

&nbsp;  

### **4. What do data analysts get paid in different industries?**

Let's see how much data analysts get paid on average based on what industry they work in.

I'll use the top 20 industries by amount of jobs postings on Glassdoor to determine this.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Sal_Indus <- data_4 %>% select(Salary, Comp_name, Industry, Location)
Sal_Indus <- subset(Sal_Indus, Industry!="-1")
Sal_Indus$Industry <- gsub(' [A-z ]*', '' ,Sal_Indus$Industry)
Sal_Indus$Industry <- gsub("&", "", Sal_Indus$Industry)
Sal_Indus$Industry <- gsub(",", "", Sal_Indus$Industry)

counts <- Sal_Indus %>% count(Industry) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#counts
top20 <- head(counts, 20)
top20  %>% kbl %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
names <- top20 %>% select(Industry)
#class(names)
names <- as.vector(names)
#class(names)
avector <- names[['Industry']]
```

These are what industries pay data analysts the most on average
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
Industry_avg_sal <- Sal_Indus %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
    summarise(avg_sal = mean(Salary)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(avg_sal)) %>% ungroup()
Industry_avg_sal$avg_sal<- round(Industry_avg_sal$avg_sal, 2)

head(Industry_avg_sal,15)  %>% kbl %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

Industry_avg_sal_2 <- head(Industry_avg_sal,10)

Industry_avg_sal_plot <- Industry_avg_sal_2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = Industry, y = avg_sal)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'orange', color = 'black') + 
    labs(title = "Average Salary for Highest Paying Industries") +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), legend.position="none") + xlab("Industry") + ylab("Average Salary (in thousands)")

Industry_avg_sal_plot + coord_flip() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```


&nbsp;  



Now. let's see how much the industries with the most amount of jobs posted pay data analysts.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Highest_sal <- Industry_avg_sal[Industry_avg_sal$Industry %in% avector, ]
Sal_plot <- Highest_sal %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Industry, - avg_sal), y = avg_sal)) +
  geom_col(fill = 'mediumorchid2', color = 'black') + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position="none")  + 
  labs(title = "Average Salary for Analysts by Industry with Most Postings") + 
  ylab("Average Industry Salary")  

Sal_plot + coord_flip() + xlab("Industry") + ylab("Average Salary (in thousands") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

&nbsp;  

### **5. What location has the most jobs for each industry?**

Now I'll investigate to find out what industry in what cities have the most amount of job postings. My guess would be that New York would have the most positions and the most industries that are currently hiring.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#Where are most jobs located by industry
data_5 <- data_4
data_5 <- data_5 %>% select(Salary, Comp_name, Industry, Location)
#shorten industry names
data_5$Industry <- gsub(' [A-z ]*', '' , data_5$Industry)
data_5$Industry <- gsub("&", "", data_5$Industry)
data_5$Industry <- gsub(",", "", data_5$Industry)
#dropping "-1" in Industry
data_5 <- data_5[!grepl("-1", data_5$Industry), ]
#Drop state after comma
data_5$Location <- gsub(",.*","",data_5$Location)

loc_count <- data_5 %>% group_by(Industry) %>% count(Location) %>% arrange(desc(n))
loc_count <- loc_count[1:20,]
loc_count  %>% kbl %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

```

&nbsp;  

New York appears to have the most postings. To make this list easier to comprehend, I'll plot number of positions per industry and facet wrap by city.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
loc_count_plot <- loc_count %>% ggplot(aes(x = Industry, y = n, fill = Industry)) + geom_col() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
    facet_wrap(~ Location)  +
      ggtitle("Number of Analyst Jobs per Industry by Location") +
        theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

loc_count_plot + xlab("Industry") + ylab("Number of Positions") + coord_flip() 
```

&nbsp;  

### **6. Text Analysis**

I'm going to use the job description column for this data to perform a text analysis to view trends such as what words are used the most often in job descriptions and what programming languages appear the most often.


**Creating a corpus**

This first thing I'll do is create a corpus, which is a way of storing data to be used for textual analysis.
```{r}
clean_data <- data_4
corpus <- SimpleCorpus(VectorSource(clean_data$`Job Description`))
```


**Cleaning the corpus**

To clean the corpus to make text analysis simpler I'll make 4 changes to it.

*  Remove extra white space
*  Transform all words to lower case
*  Remove Punctuation
*  Removing stop words

Stop words are common words of little value in text analysis, like "me, these, being," etc. They appear often and don't really provide any additional value. Here's the fill list of stop words.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
stopwords("english")
```
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# 1. strip white space
dfCorpus <- tm_map(corpus, stripWhitespace)
# 2. Transforming everything to lowercase
dfCorpus <- tm_map(dfCorpus, content_transformer(tolower))
# 3. Removing punctuation
dfCorpus <- tm_map(dfCorpus, removePunctuation)
# 4. Removing stop words
dfCorpus <- tm_map(dfCorpus, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
```

Here's what the new job descriptions look similar towards after these changes
```{r}
dfCorpus[[10]]$content
```

**Creating a Document-Term Matrix to look for specific and most frequently occurring words** 

A document-term matrix is a simple way to compare all the terms or words across each document. Viewing the data simply as a matrix results in each row representing a unique document and each column representing a unique term.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
DTM <- DocumentTermMatrix(dfCorpus)
inspect(DTM)
```
We can see we have a total of 26182 terms used throughout the 2252 job descriptions in the data set. Now I'm going to search for the names of specific  languages to determine what languages are most common for data analyst jobs in this data.

Note: R and Rstudio are not found in this method due to some type of syntax error, even after making the conversions to the corpus I made before.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_words <- c("python", "sql", 'excel')
words_dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(dfCorpus, control = list(dictionary = my_words))
words_dtm <- data.frame(docs = words_dtm$dimnames$Docs, as.matrix(words_dtm), row.names = NULL)
head(words_dtm) %>% kbl(caption = "Count of Language Names") %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
Python, SQL and Excel all have a presence in these job descriptions. Now to see how many times they are each mentioned in and what descriptions mention all 3.
```{r,include=FALSE}
words_dtm_py <- words_dtm %>% filter(python >= 1)
nrow(words_dtm_py)
#598
words_dtm_sql <- words_dtm %>% filter(sql >= 1)
nrow(words_dtm_sql)
#1318
words_dtm_xl <- words_dtm %>% filter(excel >= 1)
nrow(words_dtm_xl)
#889
words_dtm_all <- words_dtm %>% filter(excel >= 1, sql >=1, python >= 1)
nrow(words_dtm_all)
#190
```
```{r}
# Number of descriptions that mention python
nrow(words_dtm_py)

# Number of descriptions that mention sql
nrow(words_dtm_sql)

#Number of descriptions that mention excel
nrow(words_dtm_xl)

#Number of descriptions that mention all 3 languages
nrow(words_dtm_all)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
lang_count <- data.frame('Language' = c('python', 'sql', 'excel', 'all'), 'count' = c(598, 1318,889,190))

lang_count_plot <- lang_count %>% ggplot(aes(x = Language, y = count, fill = Language)) + geom_col() +
  ggtitle('Language Names Counted in Job Descriptions') + ylim(0,2000) + 
  ylab("Number of times Appeared")
lang_count_plot
```

Good thing I've been brushing up on using SQL becasue it is the most common language mentioned in job descriptions, so we can assume it is the most popular language requested to have some knowledge of or that the position would use in this dataset.

**Creating a word cloud of the most frequently appearing terms**

Word Clouds can be interesting and different ways to view the words the appear most often. Here I'll visualize the 75 most common words, after removing stop words that otherwise would clutter the list.

```{r}
#creating word cloud of most frequent terms
sums <- as.data.frame(colSums(as.matrix(DTM)))
sums <- rownames_to_column(sums) 
colnames(sums) <- c("term", "count")
sums <- arrange(sums, desc(count))
subs_sums <- sums
subs_sums <- as.data.table(subs_sums)

head <- subs_sums[1:75,]
head <- as.data.frame(head)
```

```{r}
wordcloud(words = head$term, freq = head$count, min.freq = 1000,
          max.words=100, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
```
&nbsp;  

### **7. Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiments are opinions or feelings about something. So, I'll use a sentiment analysis to capture the general feeling or tone which these job descriptions are written in. I'll view which companies and industries have the most positively and negatively written job descriptions. 

The type of sentiment analysis I will run uses the Harvard IV dictionary to detect how many negative and positive words are contained in text data. It grades the overall, positive and negative sentiment on a scale from -1 to 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sent <- analyzeSentiment(DTM, language = "english")

# were going to just select the Harvard-IV dictionary results ..  
sent <- sent[,1:4]

#Organizing it as a dataframe
sent <- as.data.frame(sent)
sent <- as.data.table(sent)

# Now lets take a look at what these sentiment values look like. 
h_sent<- head(sent)
h_sent  %>% kbl(caption = "Sentiment Analysis Polarity") %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Now I'll view the overall distribution of sentiments in this data
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sum_sent <- summary(sent$SentimentGI)
sum_sent

#Sentiment Score Distribution
sent %>% ggplot(aes(x = SentimentGI)) + geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Sentiment Scores") + xlab("Sentiment Score") +
  ylab("Number of Scores") + 
  xlim(-0.2,0.2)

```

We can see the sentiment appears to be in the shape of a normal distribution and is centered to be slightly more positive than a neutral sentiment of zero.

**Viewing the most positive and negative job postings**

I wanted to see what companies and what industries have the most polarizing job descriptions in terms of sentiment.
First I need to bind the columns from my sentiments analysis to the rest of the data, then I can analyze them.

Here are the companies with the highest and lowest sentiments in their job descriptions.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
clean_data_2 <- clean_data
final <- bind_cols(clean_data_2, sent)
final <- subset(final, Industry!="-1")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#companies with highest and lowest sentiment
top_10_comp <- final %>% group_by(Comp_name, Industry ) %>%
  summarize(sent = mean(SentimentGI)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sent)) %>% head(n = 10) %>% ungroup()
top_10_comp %>% kbl(caption = "Highest Sentiment Companies") %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

bottom_1_comp <- final %>% group_by(Comp_name, Industry ) %>%
  summarize(sent = mean(SentimentGI)) %>%
  arrange(sent) %>% head(n = 10) %>% ungroup()
bottom_1_comp %>% kbl(caption = "Lowest Sentiment Companies") %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

```

Now the industries with the highest and lowest sentiment.

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
top_indus <- final %>% group_by(Industry ) %>%
  summarize(sent = mean(SentimentGI)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sent)) %>% head(n = 10) %>% ungroup()
top_indus %>% kbl(caption = "Highest Sentiment Industries") %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")


bottom_indus <- final %>% group_by(Industry ) %>%
  summarize(sent = mean(SentimentGI)) %>%
  arrange(sent) %>% head(n = 10) %>% ungroup()
bottom_indus %>% kbl(caption = "Lowest Sentiment Companies") %>% kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

```

Sentiments appear pretty neutral in general. I suppose it is intuitive that you're not going to find anything too joyful or dark in a data-analyst job description.
